# Business Analytics with Power BI Portfolio


Welcome to my portfolio repository for the **Udacity Business Analytics with Power BI Nanodegree**. This project collection demonstrates my skills in data collection, analysis, visualization, and decision-making using tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL. Through three structured courses, I worked on real-world datasets to build interactive reports, query databases, and derive business insights.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three folders, each corresponding to one course in the Nanodegree program. Each folder contains:
- **Project files**: Power BI (.pbix) reports, Excel workbooks (.xlsx), and SQL scripts.
- **Datasets**: Raw and cleaned data files (CSV/Excel/SQL dumps).
- **Documentation**: Screenshots, explanations, and key learnings.

| Folder     | Course Focus                          | Key Projects                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **course-1** | Data Fundamentals with Excel & SQL    | Basic data manipulation in Excel and introductory SQL queries (e.g., cleaning and aggregating sales data). |
| **course-2** | Advanced Analysis and Modeling        | SQL joins, subqueries, and Power BI data modeling (e.g., customer analytics dashboard). |
| **course-3** | Capstone Project                      | End-to-end business analytics project integrating Excel, SQL, and Power BI (e.g., comprehensive revenue forecasting report). |

## Skills Demonstrated
